// TO DO
- Give it a little tab icon!

// TO FIX / IMPROVE
- Maybe load the full res background image if the monitor has a resolution higher than 1080p

// FIXED
Issue: When making the window thiner, a white space appears under the background :/
Solution: Add html {height: 100%} to CSS (saw it in an old Colt project)

Issue: The logo animation would generate just like 99% of the outline
Solution: Made stroke-dasharray: 0 at the end with js using: logo[i].addEventListener("animationend", (event) => event.path[0].classList.add("full-path")); and adding that to the class
